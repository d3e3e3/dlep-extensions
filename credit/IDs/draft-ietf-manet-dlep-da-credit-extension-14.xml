<t>
  This document defines an extension to the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) that enables a
  DiffServ aware credit-window scheme for destination-specific and
  shared flow control.
</t>
</abstract>

<section anchor="sec-1" title="Introduction">
<t>
  The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in <xref
  target="RFC8175"/>.  It provides the exchange of link
  related control information between DLEP peers.  DLEP peers are
  comprised of a modem and a router.  DLEP defines a base set of
  mechanisms as well as support for possible extensions.  This
  document defines one such extension.
</t>
<t>
  The base DLEP specification does not include any flow control
  capability.  There are various flow control techniques theoretically possible
  with DLEP.
  This document defines a DLEP extension which provides a DiffServ-based
  flow control mechanism for traffic sent from a router to a modem. Flow
  control is provided using one or more logical "Credit Windows", each of
  which will typically be supported by an associated virtual or physical
  queue.  A router will use traffic flow classification
  information provided by the modem to identify which traffic is
  associated with each credit window.
  Credit windows may be shared or dedicated on a per flow basis.
  See <xref target="I-D.berger-manet-dlep-ether-credit-extension"/> for
  an Ethernet-based version of credit window flow control.
</t>
<t>
  This document uses the traffic classification and credit window
  control mechanisms defined in <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/> and <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control"/> to provide credit
  window based flow control based on DLEP destinations and DiffServ
  <xref target="RFC2475"/> DSCPs (differentiated services codepoints).
  The defined mechanism allows for credit windows to be shared across
  traffic sent to multiple DLEP destinations and DSCPs, or used
  exclusively for traffic sent to a particular destination and/or DSCP.
  The extension also supports the "wildcard" matching of any DSCP.
</t>
<t>
  The extension defined in this document is referred to as "DiffServ
  Aware Credit Window" or, more simply, the "DA Credit" extension. The
  reader should be familiar with both the traffic classification and
  credit window control mechanisms defined in <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/> and <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control"/>.
</t>
<t>
  This document defines a new DLEP Extension Type Value in <xref
  target="sec-ext-type"/> which is used to indicate support for the
  extension.

  <t>
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and
   only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

<section anchor="sec-ext-type" title="Extension Usage and Identification">
<t>
   The extension defined in this document is composed of the mechanisms
   and processing defined in <xref
   target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/> and <xref
   target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control"/>.  To indicate that the
   DiffServ Aware Credit Window Extension is to be used, an
   implementation MUST include the DiffServ Aware Credit Window Type
   Value in the Extensions Supported Data Item.  The Extensions
   Supported Data Item is sent and processed according to <xref
   target="RFC8175"/>.  Any implementation that indicates use of the
   DiffServ Aware Credit Window Extension MUST support all Messages,
   Data Items, the DiffServ Traffic Classification Sub-Data Item, and all
   related processing defined in <xref
   target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/> and <xref
   target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control"/>.
</t>
<t>
  The DiffServ Aware Credit Window Extension Type Value is TBA1, see
  <xref target="sec-iana"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sec-mgmnt" title="Management Considerations">
  <t>
    This section provides several network management guidelines
    to implementations supporting the DiffServ Aware Credit Window
    Extension.
  </t>
  <t>
    The use of the extension defined in this document SHOULD be
    configurable on both modems and routers.
  </t>
  <t>
    Modems SHOULD support the configuration of DSCP to credit
    window (queue) mapping.
  </t>
  <t>
    Modems MAY support the configuration of the number of credit
    windows (queues) to advertise to a router.
  </t>
  <t>
    Routers may have limits on the number of queues that they can
    support and, perhaps, even limits in supported credit window
    combinations, e.g., if per destination queues can even be
    supported at all.  When modem-provided credit window information
    exceeds the capabilities of a router, the router MAY use a subset of
    the provided credit windows.  Alternatively, a router MAY reset the
    session and indicate that the extension is not supported.  In either
    case, the mismatch of capabilities SHOULD be reported to the user via
    normal network management mechanisms, e.g., user interface or error
    logging.
  </t>

<section anchor="sec-sec" title="Security Considerations">
  <t>
    This document defines a DLEP extension that uses base DLEP
    mechanisms and the credit window control and flow mechanisms defined
    in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/> and
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control"/>.  The use of
    those mechanisms, and the introduction of a new extension, do not
    inherently introduce any additional vulnerabilities above those documented
    in <xref target="RFC8175"/>.  The approach taken to Security in that
    document applies equally to the mechanism defined in this document.

     The Sub-Data item format was inspired by Rick Taylor's "Data Item
     Containers".  He also proposed the separation of credit windows from
     traffic classification at IETF98. Many useful comments were
     received from contributors to the MANET working group, notably
     Ronald in't Velt.
